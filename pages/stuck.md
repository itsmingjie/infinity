* If youâ€™re stuck, look at the [inteGIRLS Guide to Puzzle Solving](/guide.pdf)
* Use Google!! Many of the puzzles will be impossible to solve without using the Internet.
* EXTREMELY USEFUL WEBSITES: [Nutrimatic](https://nutrimatic.org/) and [dCode](https://www.dcode.fr/en).
* EXTREMELY COMMON MECHANIC: indexing: for example INTEGIRLS [5] is G, the 5th letter.
* Some of the puzzles will give a phrase that has to be turned into the answer. For example, the phrase MIRZAKHANIFIRSTNAME, referencing the Iranian mathematician Maryam Mirzkhani, would lead to the answer MARYAM.
* In August, inteGIRLS hosted a [Puzzle 101 seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q58qw-H6SMQ&feature=youtu.be) where we went over the basics of solving puzzles.
