# Rules

... [WIP]

## Use of Platform

**Infinity** is the platform designed and used by inteGIRLS to host, run, and maintain the puzzle hunt competition. You're subject to the following rules when participating in the competition:

1. During the puzzle hunt, it wonâ€™t be necessary to look at the HTML source/Javascript/CSS on any webpages in order to solve the puzzles.

1. Each IP address will be limited to at most one guess per second to prevent brute-forcing.

1. You may not write any code to interact with the verification server of Infinity to solve the puzzles. **Your team may be disqualified if we detect such attempt during the competition.**

1. In order to maintain fairness of the competition, all interactions of every user of the platform will be recorded, even when you are logged out. Sensitive information like passwords will be redacted from the recording. Competition admins reserve the right to check any suspicion of cheating against these logs.

Additionally, **Infinity** is an open-source software written by Mingjie Jiang ([@itsmingjie](https://mingjie.dev)) for the inteGIRLS team. You can find the source code of the platform on [GitHub](https://github.com/itsmingjie/infinity). Security patches, feature improvements, and issue reports are always welcome. Development instructions are included in the repository.

The software is released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/itsmingjie/infinity/blob/main/README.md), a short, permissive software license allowing for redistribution of the software, even commercially, as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source. We also ask that you contact Mingjie at [hi@mingjie.dev](mailto:hi@mingjie.dev) before you use this software for other purposes.
